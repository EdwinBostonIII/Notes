[Genesis 2:1-3] — THE SEVENTH DAY: DIVINE REST AND THE HALLOWING OF TIME
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיְכֻלּ֛וּ הַשָּׁמַ֥יִם וְהָאָ֖רֶץ וְכָל־צְבָאָֽם׃ וַיְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י מְלַאכְתּ֖וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה וַיִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּ֖וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׁה׃ וַיְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־י֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י וַיְקַדֵּ֖שׁ אֹת֑וֹ כִּ֣י ב֤וֹ שָׁבַת֙ מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּ֔וֹ אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַעֲשֽׂוֹת׃

"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished (וַיְכֻלּוּ, vayekhullu), and all their host (צְבָאָם, tzeva'am). And on the seventh day (בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי, bayyom hashevi'i) God finished his work (מְלַאכְתּוֹ, melakhto) that he had done, and he rested (וַיִּשְׁבֹּת, vayyishbot) on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed (וַיְבָרֶךְ, vayevarekh) the seventh day and made it holy (וַיְקַדֵּשׁ אֹתוֹ, vayqaddesh oto), because on it God rested from all his work that he had created to make (בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים לַעֲשׂוֹת, bara Elohim la'asot)."

EXEGESIS:
The seventh day uniquely lacks the refrain "and there was evening and there was morning"—suggesting the Sabbath remains perpetually open, an eschatological reality into which humanity is invited to enter. The threefold repetition of הַשְּׁבִיעִי ("the seventh") emphasizes its centrality, while the verb שָׁבַת (from which "Sabbath" derives) means not exhausted inactivity but satisfied completion—God rests not because He is tired but because His work is finished. The final phrase בָּרָא... לַעֲשׂוֹת ("created to make") combines the two verbs of divine creativity from Genesis 1, suggesting that creation was made with ongoing purpose—God created in order to continue making, and the Sabbath marks not termination but transition from creation to providence. The blessing and sanctification of time itself (not a place or person) establishes that holiness can inhere in temporal reality—the first thing called קָדוֹשׁ ("holy") in Scripture is a day. This consecration grounds all subsequent sabbaths: weekly Sabbath, sabbatical years, and Jubilee all participate in the primordial seventh day. The "host" (צָבָא) of heaven and earth uses military terminology—creation is an ordered army under divine command, not chaotic matter.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Hebrews 4:4, 9-11
    "For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.' ... So then, there remains a Sabbath rest (σαββατισμός, sabbatismos) for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. Let us therefore strive to enter that rest." The author of Hebrews spiritualizes Genesis 2:2-3 christologically: the Sabbath is not merely weekly observance but eschatological reality. Believers enter God's rest through faith in Christ; the promised land was a type, not the antitype. The absent evening-and-morning formula finds its explanation: the seventh day never ended—we are invited into God's ongoing Sabbath.

  → Exodus 20:8-11
    "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." The Fourth Commandment explicitly grounds Israel's Sabbath in Genesis 2:2-3—Sabbath-keeping is imitatio Dei, conforming human life to the pattern established in creation. The divine rest becomes human obligation; creation theology generates covenant ethics.

  → Mark 2:27-28
    "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath." Jesus's radical claim establishes christological priority over the Mosaic institution. If the Sabbath was "made for man" (διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον), it was made by someone with authority over it—and the Son of Man exercises that authority as Lord of creation's rhythm itself. The Creator rests; the incarnate Creator determines what rest means.

  → John 5:17
    "But Jesus answered them, 'My Father is working until now, and I am working.'" Christ's defense of Sabbath healing reveals that divine "rest" is not inactivity but different activity—providence continues even as creation ceases. The Father sustains what He made; the Son participates in that sustaining work. Sabbath rest permits divine beneficence, not prohibits it; healing on the Sabbath fulfills rather than violates the day's purpose.

  → Colossians 2:16-17
    "Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow (σκιά) of the things to come, but the substance (σῶμα) belongs to Christ." Paul relativizes Sabbath observance as typological—the σκιά ("shadow") points to the σῶμα ("body/substance") that is Christ. The seventh-day rest anticipated the eternal rest secured by Christ's finished work. Christians who rest in Christ fulfill what Sabbath always signified.

[Genesis 2:4] — THE TOLEDOT FORMULA: GENERATIONS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

אֵ֣לֶּה תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַשָּׁמַ֛יִם וְהָאָ֖רֶץ בְּהִבָּֽרְאָ֑ם בְּי֗וֹם עֲשׂ֛וֹת יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶ֥רֶץ וְשָׁמָֽיִם׃

"These are the generations (אֵלֶּה תוֹלְדוֹת, eleh toledot) of the heavens and the earth when they were created (בְּהִבָּרְאָם, behibbare'am), in the day that the LORD God (יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, YHWH Elohim) made earth and heavens."

EXEGESIS:
This transitional verse introduces the תּוֹלְדוֹת ("generations/descendants") formula that will structure all of Genesis—appearing ten times to organize the book's narrative (2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1; 37:2). Applying the genealogical term to heaven and earth personifies the cosmos as a generative entity whose "offspring" are the events and beings that follow. The first occurrence of the divine name יְהוָה (YHWH, the LORD) marks a shift from the cosmic Creator (אֱלֹהִים alone in chapter 1) to the covenant God of Israel; the compound יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים ("the LORD God") bridges the two aspects—the universal Creator is the particular Redeemer. The chiastic word order "heavens and earth... earth and heavens" forms an envelope structure linking creation's beginning to its elaboration. The phrase בְּיוֹם עֲשׂוֹת ("in the day of making") uses "day" (יוֹם) in its broader sense of "when/at the time," as throughout Hebrew usage. This verse marks not a contradictory second creation account but a re-narration from a different perspective—zooming from cosmic panorama (chapter 1) to intimate focus on humanity's formation and vocation (chapter 2).

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Genesis 5:1
    "This is the book of the generations (סֵפֶר תּוֹלְדֹת, sepher toledot) of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God." The second תּוֹלְדוֹת formula introduces Adam's descendants, paralleling 2:4's introduction of creation's development. Adam stands as creation's crown, whose genealogy will unfold the narrative toward Abraham, Israel, and ultimately Christ. The genealogical structure of Genesis traces the narrowing of blessing from all creation to one family.

  → Exodus 3:14-15
    "God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM' (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה, 'ehyeh 'asher 'ehyeh)... 'Say this to the people of Israel: "The LORD (יְהוָה), the God of your fathers... has sent me to you."'" The sacred Name first revealed to Moses in Exodus is retroactively identified as the Creator-God of Genesis. Israel's Redeemer is not a different deity but the same One who made heaven and earth. Creation and redemption are unified in the single divine purpose; the Exodus God is the Genesis God.

  → Matthew 1:1
    "The book of the genealogy (βίβλος γενέσεως, biblos geneseos) of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Matthew deliberately echoes Genesis's תּוֹלְדוֹת formula—the Gospel is the final "book of generations" completing what Genesis began. The genealogies that started with heaven and earth culminate in the Incarnation; Christ is creation's goal, not afterthought. New Testament opens by announcing itself as Genesis's fulfillment.

  → John 1:1-3
    "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him." John's prologue interprets Genesis 1-2: the YHWH Elohim who made heaven and earth is the Logos who became flesh. The Creator who spoke the cosmos into existence is the Son who tabernacled among us. Christological reading of the תּוֹלְדוֹת formula reveals the eternal Word as creation's agent.

[Genesis 2:7] — THE FORMATION OF MAN: DUST AND DIVINE BREATH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

וַיִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֗ם עָפָר֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה וַיִּפַּ֥ח בְּאַפָּ֖יו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים וַֽיְהִ֥י הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְנֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה׃

"Then the LORD God formed (וַיִּיצֶר, vayyitzer) the man (הָאָדָם, ha'adam)—dust from the ground (עָפָר מִן־הָאֲדָמָה, 'aphar min-ha'adamah)—and breathed (וַיִּפַּח, vayyippach) into his nostrils the breath of life (נִשְׁמַת חַיִּים, nishmat chayyim); and the man became a living soul (נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה, nephesh chayyah)."

EXEGESIS:
This verse contains the Bible's most intimate portrait of divine creative action. The verb יָצַר ("form, fashion") is the potter's term—YHWH Elohim works as a craftsman, shaping humanity from raw material rather than merely commanding existence. The wordplay between אָדָם ("man/Adam") and אֲדָמָה ("ground/earth") is untranslatable but fundamental: humanity is the "earthling" taken from the earth, forever bound to the soil from which we came. Yet dust alone does not constitute humanity—the נִשְׁמַת חַיִּים ("breath of life") transforms inert matter into living being. This divine insufflation (וַיִּפַּח, "he breathed into") implies direct, personal contact between Creator and creature unparalleled elsewhere in the creation account. The result—נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה ("living soul")—is the same phrase used for animals in 1:20, 24, yet only humanity receives the breath directly from God's own being. The Fathers saw in this dual constitution (earth + breath) both humanity's humility and dignity: we are dust, yet dust animated by divine Spirit. The Hebrew doubles the yod in וַיִּיצֶר—the Masoretic tradition notes this suggests humanity was formed with two inclinations (יֵצֶר טוֹב and יֵצֶר רָע, good and evil impulse), unlike animals formed with single yod.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → 1 Corinthians 15:45-47
    "Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being' (ἐγένετο... εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν); the last Adam became a life-giving spirit (πνεῦμα ζῳοποιοῦν). But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust (χοϊκός); the second man is from heaven." Paul's Adam-Christ typology interprets Genesis 2:7 christologically. The first Adam received life; the last Adam gives it. The dust-origin establishes both humanity's mortal nature and Christ's surpassing glory. The resurrection body will transcend what creation initially bestowed.

  → John 20:22
    "And when he had said this, he breathed on them (ἐνεφύσησεν, enephysēsen) and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'" The risen Christ deliberately re-enacts Genesis 2:7—the verb ἐμφυσάω appears only here and in the LXX of Genesis 2:7 (ἐνεφύσησεν). Jesus creates a new humanity by breathing the Spirit as the Creator breathed life into Adam. Redemption is re-creation; the Church is the new Eden; Pentecost completes what Easter began.

  → Ecclesiastes 12:7
    "And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit (הָרוּחַ, haruach) returns to God who gave it." Qoheleth describes death as the reversal of Genesis 2:7—what God joined, death separates. The dust returns to dust, but the spirit returns to its Source. This verse grounds the doctrine of the soul's survival of bodily death and anticipates the resurrection's reunification of what death divided.

  → Genesis 3:19
    "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground (הָאֲדָמָה), for out of it you were taken; for you are dust (עָפָר), and to dust you shall return." The curse echoes the creation—the word-pair עָפָר/אֲדָמָה from 2:7 reappears in judgment. Death is return to origin; the breath departs, and what remains is what was always there beneath the animation. The Fall does not undo creation but reveals its contingency.

  → Job 33:4
    "The Spirit of God (רוּחַ־אֵל, ruach-El) has made me, and the breath of the Almighty (נִשְׁמַת שַׁדַּי, nishmat Shaddai) gives me life." Elihu recognizes that every human life participates in Adam's pattern—each person exists by divine breath, not merely by biological generation. The creation-gift is not a one-time event but ongoing divine sustenance. God breathes still; every life is miracle.

  → Isaiah 64:8
    "But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay (חֹמֶר, chomer), and you are our potter (יֹצֵר, yotzer); we are all the work of your hand." Isaiah's communal confession applies the creation metaphor to Israel's relationship with YHWH—the יָצַר of Genesis 2:7 grounds the יֹצֵר language of prophetic petition. If God formed humanity from dust, He can reform a rebellious people. Creation theology becomes basis for redemption hope.

[Genesis 2:8-9] — THE GARDEN IN EDEN: THE TWO TREES AND DIVINE HORTICULTURE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים גַּן־בְעֵ֖דֶן מִקֶּ֑דֶם וַיָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר׃ וַיַּצְמַ֞ח יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה כָּל־עֵ֛ץ נֶחְמָ֥ד לְמַרְאֶ֖ה וְט֣וֹב לְמַאֲכָ֑ל וְעֵ֤ץ הַֽחַיִּים֙ בְּת֣וֹךְ הַגָּ֔ן וְעֵ֕ץ הַדַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע׃

"And the LORD God planted (וַיִּטַּע, vayyitta') a garden (גַּן, gan) in Eden (בְעֵדֶן, ve'Eden), in the east (מִקֶּדֶם, miqqedem); and there he put (וַיָּשֶׂם, vayyasem) the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up (וַיַּצְמַח, vayyatzmach) every tree that is pleasant to the sight (נֶחְמָד לְמַרְאֶה, nechmad lemar'eh) and good for food (טוֹב לְמַאֲכָל, tov lema'akhal). The tree of life (עֵץ הַחַיִּים, 'etz hachayyim) was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (עֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע, 'etz hada'at tov vara')."

EXEGESIS:
YHWH Elohim becomes divine Gardener—the verb נָטַע ("plant") depicts God engaged in agricultural labor, preparing a home for His image-bearer. The name עֵדֶן means "delight/pleasure," while גַּן (from גָּנַן, "to defend/protect") suggests an enclosed, protected space—a divine sanctuary walled off from the uncultivated world outside. The location מִקֶּדֶם ("in/toward the east") establishes the garden as the place of sunrise and beginning, though after expulsion, the east becomes the direction of exile (Cain goes "east of Eden" in 4:16). The trees are described with aesthetic and practical criteria: נֶחְמָד לְמַרְאֶה ("desirable to the sight") and טוֹב לְמַאֲכָל ("good for food")—beauty and utility united, foreshadowing Eve's fateful evaluation in 3:6. The two named trees occupy the garden's center—עֵץ הַחַיִּים ("tree of life") offers what its name promises, perpetual vitality, while עֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע ("tree of the knowledge of good and evil") presents the defining test of human obedience. These trees represent two paths: life through trust in God's provision, or autonomous determination of good and evil. The garden is temple: God walks there (3:8), and humanity serves as priest-gardener. Eden establishes the pattern for all subsequent sacred spaces—tabernacle and temple are Eden rebuilt.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Revelation 2:7
    "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life (τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς), which is in the paradise of God (ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ θεοῦ)." Christ promises the overcomers what Adam forfeited. The "paradise" (παράδεισος, from Persian "enclosed garden") is the LXX's translation of גַּן—Eden restored in the new creation. Access to the tree of life, barred by cherubim since the Fall, is reopened through Christ's victory.

  → Revelation 22:2, 14
    "Through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month... Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates." The Apocalypse's final chapter depicts the עֵץ הַחַיִּים multiplied and accessible—not one tree in a lost garden but trees lining the New Jerusalem's river. The eschatological city is Eden urbanized, the garden become metropolis, with perpetual access to what Adam could only briefly enjoy.

  → Ezekiel 28:13-14
    "You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering... You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God." Ezekiel's oracle against the king of Tyre uses Edenic imagery, identifying the garden as divine sanctuary where a guardian cherub once walked. This text suggests Eden was not merely garden but mountain-temple, the meeting place of heaven and earth—a concept that illuminates the tabernacle and temple as Eden-recapitulations.

  → Ezekiel 31:8-9
    "The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it; the fir trees were not like its boughs; neither were the plane trees like its branches; no tree in the garden of God was its equal in beauty. I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees of Eden envied it." In this oracle against Pharaoh, the trees of Eden serve as the superlative standard of arboreal magnificence. The garden's vegetation becomes proverbial for unmatched beauty and abundance—what God planted exceeds all subsequent cultivation.

  → Proverbs 3:18
    "She is a tree of life (עֵץ חַיִּים, 'etz chayyim) to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed." Wisdom literature appropriates the עֵץ הַחַיִּים imagery—divine Wisdom herself becomes the tree whose fruit grants life. The sapiential tradition identifies the path to life not with physical location but with moral-spiritual orientation; Torah and Wisdom replace the lost tree.

[Genesis 2:15-17] — THE ADAMIC VOCATION: PRIESTLY SERVICE AND THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיִּקַּ֛ח יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֑ם וַיַּנִּחֵ֣הוּ בְגַן־עֵ֔דֶן לְעָבְדָ֖הּ וּלְשָׁמְרָֽהּ׃ וַיְצַו֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַל־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר מִכֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל׃ וּמֵעֵ֗ץ הַדַּ֙עַת֙ ט֣וֹב וָרָ֔ע לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם אֲכָלְךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת׃

"The LORD God took the man and put him (וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ, vayyannicheihu) in the garden of Eden to work it (לְעָבְדָהּ, le'ovdah) and to keep it (וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ, uleshomrah). And the LORD God commanded (וַיְצַו, vayetzav) the man, saying, 'You may surely eat (אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל, 'akhol tokhel) of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat (לֹא תֹאכַל, lo tokhal), for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die (מוֹת תָּמוּת, mot tamut).'"

EXEGESIS:
Adam's vocation is defined by two infinitives: לְעָבְדָהּ ("to serve/work it") and לְשָׁמְרָהּ ("to guard/keep it")—the identical word-pair later describes Levitical service (Numbers 3:7-8; 8:26; 18:7), revealing Eden as the first sanctuary and Adam as the first priest. The verb נוּחַ (hiphil וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ, "he caused him to rest/settle") connects humanity's placement in Eden to Sabbath rest—the garden is humanity's resting place as it is God's. The prohibition's grammar emphasizes both permission and restriction: the infinitive absolute construction אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל ("eating you shall eat"—emphatic permission) balances the equally emphatic death warning מוֹת תָּמוּת ("dying you shall die"). God's first word to humanity is gift before demand—radical permission ("every tree") precedes singular prohibition ("but not this one"). The "knowledge of good and evil" (דַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע) likely denotes autonomous moral determination—the capacity to decide for oneself what is beneficial and harmful, independent of divine revelation. The death-penalty is not arbitrary punishment but organic consequence: to cut oneself off from the Source of life is to embrace death. The phrase בְּיוֹם ("in the day") suggests immediate consequence, though physical death was delayed; spiritual death—separation from God—occurred instantly.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Romans 5:12, 17-19
    "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned... For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ." Paul's Adam-Christ typology treats Genesis 2:17's מוֹת תָּמוּת as the origin of universal mortality. Adam's single act of disobedience introduced death as cosmic reality; Christ's single act of obedience introduces life. The "one man" structure of Romans 5 presupposes the historical solidarity established in Eden.

  → Romans 6:23
    "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Paul condenses Genesis 2:17 into aphorism—sin pays wages, and that wage is death. The creation-covenant principle (disobedience = death) becomes the fixed moral law of the universe. Yet grace exceeds law: where sin pays wages earned, God gives gifts unmerited.

  → James 1:14-15
    "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death." James traces the Genesis pattern through every subsequent temptation: desire conceives sin, sin births death. The sequence established in Eden—see, desire, take, die—recurs in every human heart. The serpent's method remains constant.

  → 1 Corinthians 15:21-22
    "For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." The death that entered through Adam's disobedience is reversed through Christ's resurrection. The universal scope of Adam's fall ("all die") is matched by the universal scope of Christ's victory ("all be made alive"). The two Adams define the two humanities.

  → Hosea 6:7
    "But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me." Hosea explicitly names Adam's sin as covenant-breaking, confirming that Genesis 2:16-17 constitutes a covenant (the "covenant of works" in Reformed theology). Israel's unfaithfulness recapitulates Adam's—the Sinai covenant is a second Edenic opportunity, and Israel fails as Adam failed.

[Genesis 2:18] — THE FIRST "NOT GOOD": SOLITUDE AND THE PROMISE OF A HELPER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹא־ט֛וֹב הֱי֥וֹת הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְבַדּ֑וֹ אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־לּ֥וֹ עֵ֖זֶר כְּנֶגְדּֽוֹ׃

"Then the LORD God said, 'It is not good (לֹא־טוֹב, lo-tov) that the man should be alone (לְבַדּוֹ, levaddo); I will make him a helper (עֵזֶר, 'ezer) corresponding to him (כְּנֶגְדּוֹ, kenegdo).'"

EXEGESIS:
The first negative divine assessment—לֹא־טוֹב ("not good")—ruptures the sevenfold כִּי־טוֹב ("it was good") of chapter 1, creating narrative tension that will be resolved in woman's creation. Humanity alone, even in Eden's perfection, is incomplete; the image-bearing creature requires community to fulfill its nature. The term עֵזֶר ("helper") carries no connotation of inferiority—it is frequently used of God Himself as Israel's helper (Exodus 18:4; Deuteronomy 33:7, 26, 29; Psalm 33:20; 70:5; 121:1-2). The crucial modifier כְּנֶגְדּוֹ literally means "corresponding to him" or "as his opposite/counterpart"—she is neither identical (mere clone) nor wholly other (different species), but complementary partner. The word combines נֶגֶד ("opposite, facing") with the preposition כְּ ("as, like"), suggesting one who faces him as equal yet different. This verse establishes that human beings are inherently relational—the image of the Triune God cannot be fully borne by a solitary individual. Adam's naming of the animals (verses 19-20) demonstrates no creature exists כְּנֶגְדּוֹ—only another human can fulfill this role. Marriage, then, is not mere social convenience but creational necessity; solitude, though sometimes holy, is not humanity's normative condition.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → 1 Corinthians 11:8-9, 11-12
    "For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man... Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God." Paul appeals to Genesis 2:18's creation order while insisting on mutual dependence "in the Lord." The עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ relationship involves both origin (woman from man's side) and interdependence (all subsequent men from women's womb).

  → Ecclesiastes 4:9-12
    "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?" Qoheleth generalizes the לֹא־טוֹב לְבַדּוֹ principle beyond marriage to all human companionship. The creation pattern—community over isolation—pervades wisdom literature. Human solidarity is not optional luxury but practical necessity.

  → Proverbs 18:22
    "He who finds a wife finds a good thing (מָצָא טוֹב, matza tov) and obtains favor from the LORD." The עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ is explicitly identified as טוֹב—remedying the לֹא־טוֹב of solitude. The verb מָצָא ("find") suggests discovery of something precious, not casual acquisition. Marriage reverses Eden's temporary deficiency.

  → Psalm 121:1-2
    "I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help (עֶזְרִי, 'ezri) come? My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth." The identical root עֵזֶר describes both woman's role and God's role—helper is a dignified, even divine, function. The psalm's invocation of the Creator (עֹשֵׂה שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ) connects back to Genesis: the God who made the עֵזֶר for Adam continues to be עֵזֶר for all His people.

[Genesis 2:21-22] — THE DEEP SLEEP: WOMAN FORMED FROM MAN'S SIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

וַיַּפֵּל֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים׀ תַּרְדֵּמָ֛ה עַל־הָאָדָ֖ם וַיִּישָׁ֑ן וַיִּקַּ֗ח אַחַת֙ מִצַּלְעֹתָ֔יו וַיִּסְגֹּ֥ר בָּשָׂ֖ר תַּחְתֶּֽנָּה׃ וַיִּבֶן֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים׀ אֶֽת־הַצֵּלָ֛ע אֲשֶׁר־לָקַ֥ח מִן־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְאִשָּׁ֑ה וַיְבִאֶ֖הָ אֶל־הָֽאָדָֽם׃

"So the LORD God caused a deep sleep (תַּרְדֵּמָה, tardemah) to fall upon the man, and while he slept he took one of his ribs (מִצַּלְעֹתָיו, mittzal'otav) and closed up its place with flesh. And the LORD God built (וַיִּבֶן, vayyiven) the rib (הַצֵּלָע, hatzela') that he had taken from the man into a woman (לְאִשָּׁה, le'ishah) and brought her (וַיְבִאֶהָ, vayevi'eha) to the man."

EXEGESIS:
The תַּרְדֵּמָה ("deep sleep") is not ordinary slumber but divine anesthesia—the same term describes Abraham's prophetic trance (Genesis 15:12) and Saul's supernatural stupor (1 Samuel 26:12). God alone acts while Adam remains passive; woman's creation is wholly divine work, not human achievement. The צֵלָע (traditionally "rib") may better be rendered "side"—the word elsewhere denotes the side of the ark (Exodus 25:12, 14), the temple (1 Kings 6:34), or the mountain (2 Samuel 16:13). This suggests woman is formed not from a minor bone but from Adam's very side—his equal, not inferior. The verb בָּנָה ("build") is architectural, used of constructing cities, houses, and altars; YHWH is master Builder, fashioning the עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ with deliberate craftsmanship. The scene culminates with divine presentation—וַיְבִאֶהָ אֶל־הָאָדָם ("he brought her to the man")—depicting God as the first father giving the bride away. The Fathers universally saw typological significance: as Eve emerged from Adam's opened side during the "sleep" of creation, so the Church (Christ's Bride) emerges from Christ's pierced side during the "sleep" of death on the cross.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → John 19:34
    "But one of the soldiers pierced his side (πλευράν, pleuran) with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water." The Fathers from earliest times connected Adam's opened side to Christ's pierced side. As the first Adam's side produced Eve while he slept, the second Adam's side produced the Church (through baptismal water and Eucharistic blood) while He "slept" in death. The Greek πλευρά corresponds to Hebrew צֵלָע; John's Gospel invites the typological reading.

  → Ephesians 5:25-27
    "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish." Paul's marriage theology is built on the Adam-Eve/Christ-Church typology. Christ's self-giving "death" (the cross as divine תַּרְדֵּמָה) produces a Bride whom He will present (as God presented Eve) glorious and spotless.

  → Ephesians 5:30-32
    "Because we are members of his body. 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' This mystery (μυστήριον) is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church." Paul explicitly declares that Genesis 2:21-24 finds its ultimate meaning in Christ and the Church. The Adam-Eve union was always μυστήριον—a mystery pointing beyond itself to the greater union. Woman from man's side; Church from Christ's side.

  → 1 Timothy 2:13
    "For Adam was formed first, then Eve." Paul appeals to the sequence of Genesis 2:21-22 for theological argument. The creation-order establishes a pattern that continues in the Church's life. Priority of formation does not imply superiority of worth but does establish the pattern of headship and response.

  → 2 Corinthians 11:2-3
    "For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ." Paul's metaphor casts himself as the divine Father presenting the Bride (Corinthian church) to Christ (the Bridegroom), echoing וַיְבִאֶהָ אֶל־הָאָדָם. The serpent's deception of Eve becomes warning for the Church's vulnerability.

[Genesis 2:23] — ADAM'S EXCLAMATION: BONE OF MY BONE, FLESH OF MY FLESH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיֹּאמֶר֮ הָֽאָדָם֒ זֹ֣את הַפַּ֗עַם עֶ֚צֶם מֵֽעֲצָמַ֔י וּבָשָׂ֖ר מִבְּשָׂרִ֑י לְזֹאת֙ יִקָּרֵ֣א אִשָּׁ֔ה כִּ֥י מֵאִ֖ישׁ לֻֽקֳחָה־זֹּֽאת׃

"Then the man said, 'This at last (זֹאת הַפַּעַם, zot happa'am) is bone of my bones (עֶצֶם מֵעֲצָמַי, 'etzem me'atzamai) and flesh of my flesh (בָשָׂר מִבְּשָׂרִי, basar mibesari); she shall be called Woman (אִשָּׁה, 'ishah), because she was taken out of Man (מֵאִישׁ, me'ish).'"

EXEGESIS:
Adam's first recorded speech is poetry—three rhythmic lines celebrating woman's arrival. The phrase זֹאת הַפַּעַם ("this at last/this time") implies the parade of animals (verses 19-20) left Adam still seeking what no creature could provide; now his search is ended. The declaration עֶצֶם מֵעֲצָמַי וּבָשָׂר מִבְּשָׂרִי becomes covenant-making formula throughout Scripture, denoting the deepest possible kinship (Genesis 29:14; Judges 9:2; 2 Samuel 5:1; 19:12-13). Adam recognizes in woman not a stranger but his own substance returned—she is literally part of him. The Hebrew wordplay אִשָּׁה/אִישׁ (woman/man) is untranslatable but essential: the feminine form derives from the masculine, reflecting her origin from his side. This is Adam's first exercise of the naming authority given in 2:19-20—but unlike naming animals, naming woman recognizes essential kinship, not mere dominion. The exclamation expresses both wonder and ownership, delight and responsibility. Christ will speak similarly of His Bride: "You are my people" (Hosea 2:23); the Church is formed from His wounded side.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Ephesians 5:28-30
    "In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body." Paul applies the "bone and flesh" language to Christ-Church relationship. The Church is Christ's own substance as Eve was Adam's—hence Christ's self-sacrifice for the Church is not loss but self-care. The marital logic works because of the creational reality.

  → Genesis 29:14
    "Laban said to him, 'Surely you are my bone and my flesh (עַצְמִי וּבְשָׂרִי, 'atzmi ubesari)!' And he stayed with him a month." Laban's recognition of Jacob echoes Adam's recognition of Eve—the formula establishes kinship bonds that carry legal and relational significance. Family is created when one recognizes another as "bone of my bone."

  → 2 Samuel 5:1
    "Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, 'Behold, we are your bone and flesh (עַצְמְךָ וּבְשָׂרְךָ, 'atzmekha ubesarkha).'" Israel's acceptance of David as king uses the Genesis 2:23 formula—political covenant employs marriage language. To be ruled by David is to be united with him as bride to bridegroom, as Eve to Adam.

  → Song of Solomon 2:16
    "My beloved is mine, and I am his." The Song's mutual belonging language continues Genesis 2:23's recognition pattern. Human marriage and divine-human covenant share the same grammar of exclusive mutual possession and intimate identification.

[Genesis 2:24] — THE ONE-FLESH PRINCIPLE: MARRIAGE AS CREATION ORDINANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

עַל־כֵּן֙ יַֽעֲזָב־אִ֔ישׁ אֶת־אָבִ֖יו וְאֶת־אִמּ֑וֹ וְדָבַ֣ק בְּאִשְׁתּ֔וֹ וְהָי֖וּ לְבָשָׂ֥ר אֶחָֽד׃

"Therefore (עַל־כֵּן, 'al-ken) a man shall leave (יַעֲזָב, ya'azov) his father and his mother and hold fast (וְדָבַק, vedavaq) to his wife, and they shall become one flesh (לְבָשָׂר אֶחָד, levasar 'echad)."

EXEGESIS:
This etiological conclusion—עַל־כֵּן ("therefore/for this reason")—draws universal principle from particular narrative: what happened uniquely with Adam and Eve establishes the permanent pattern for all marriage. The structure moves through three stages: departure (עָזַב, "leave/forsake"), attachment (דָּבַק, "cleave/cling"), and union (הָיָה לְבָשָׂר אֶחָד, "become one flesh"). The verb דָּבַק is the covenant-loyalty term—it describes Israel's commanded devotion to YHWH (Deuteronomy 10:20; 11:22; 13:5; 30:20) and Ruth's faithful attachment to Naomi (Ruth 1:14). Marriage thus participates in covenant theology from its inception. The "one flesh" (בָשָׂר אֶחָד) denotes not merely sexual union but ontological merger—two persons become a single relational entity. Jesus will cite this verse as creation-legislation superior to Mosaic accommodation (Matthew 19:4-6; Mark 10:6-9), establishing marriage's permanence as divine intent. Paul discovers in this verse the "mystery" (μυστήριον) of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32)—the ultimate one-flesh union toward which all human marriage points.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Matthew 19:4-6
    "He answered, 'Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh"? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.'" Jesus cites Genesis 2:24 as divine speech (not merely human narration) establishing marriage's permanent, exclusive nature. The Creator's word trumps Mosaic concession; divorce was permitted because of hardness of hearts, not original design.

  → Mark 10:7-9
    "'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate." Mark's parallel emphasizes the transformation: "no longer two but one." The one-flesh reality renders separation a violent tearing of what God united. Marriage is not contract but covenant; not human arrangement but divine joining.

  → Ephesians 5:31-32
    "'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' This mystery (τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο) is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church (εἰς Χριστὸν καὶ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν)." Paul's stunning declaration reveals Genesis 2:24's ultimate referent: the one-flesh union always pointed to Christ and His Bride. Every human marriage is icon of the greater mystery; every marital union participates in and witnesses to the Christ-Church union.

  → 1 Corinthians 6:16-17
    "Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh.' But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him." Paul applies בָשָׂר אֶחָד with sobering force: sexual union creates genuine union, whether within marriage or outside it. Hence fornication damages the believer's union with Christ—the one-flesh reality is not mere metaphor but spiritual-physical fact.

  → Malachi 2:14-16
    "'The LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.' ... 'For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence.'" Malachi invokes the Genesis 2:24 covenant structure against divorce. Marriage is witnessed covenant; divorce is violence. The one-flesh union, once formed, cannot be dissolved without tearing what God joined.

[Genesis 2:25] — PRIMORDIAL INNOCENCE: NAKED AND UNASHAMED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיִּֽהְי֤וּ שְׁנֵיהֶם֙ עֲרוּמִּ֔ים הָֽאָדָ֖ם וְאִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וְלֹ֖א יִתְבֹּשָֽׁשׁוּ׃

"And they were both naked (עֲרוּמִּים, 'arummim), the man and his wife, and were not ashamed (וְלֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ, velo yitboshashu)."

EXEGESIS:
This concluding verse of chapter 2 establishes the baseline of innocence against which chapter 3's tragedy will be measured. The word עָרוּם ("naked") creates a deliberate wordplay with עָרוּם ("crafty/shrewd") in 3:1—the naked couple will encounter the subtle serpent, and the homonym signals the connection. Nakedness here signifies vulnerability without fear, transparency without shame—they have nothing to hide from God or each other. The verb בּוֹשׁ ("be ashamed") in the hitpael reflexive (יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ) suggests they did not make each other ashamed—there was no cause for mutual embarrassment or self-protective concealment. This pre-Fall condition represents humanity's original glory: clothed in light, in righteousness, in divine presence—nakedness was not deficiency but sufficiency. The Fathers spoke of humanity clothed in God's grace, the "garments of light" later replaced by "garments of skin" (3:21). Shame entered only when sin created distance between persons and God; before the Fall, perfect communion rendered covering unnecessary. Chapter 2's ending anticipates chapter 3's beginning: innocence prepares for temptation; what was "naked without shame" will become "naked and afraid."

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Genesis 3:7, 10-11
    "Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked (עֵירֻמִּם, 'erummim). And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths... 'I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.' He said, 'Who told you that you were naked?'" The contrast is devastating: what required no covering now demands immediate concealment. Shame entered through sin; nakedness unchanged, but perception transformed. The wordplay עֲרוּמִּים/עֵירֻמִּם spans the Fall.

  → Isaiah 47:3
    "Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your disgrace shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one." Nakedness in fallen creation becomes metaphor for judgment and exposure—the opposite of Edenic innocence. What was natural before sin becomes shameful after it; divine vengeance strips away false coverings and exposes guilt.

  → Revelation 3:17-18
    "For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked (γυμνός). I counsel you to buy from me... white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen." Christ counsels Laodicea to recover what Eden lost—the white garments of righteousness that replace fig-leaf self-justification. Redemption provides covering that nature cannot supply; the Church receives what Adam forfeited.

  → 2 Corinthians 5:2-4
    "For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life." Paul's hope is not mere restoration of Edenic nakedness but glorified embodiment—the resurrection body exceeds what was lost. The Christian hope is not to return to Genesis 2:25's innocence but to surpass it in glory.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                   COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESIS OF GENESIS 2
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## THE STRUCTURE OF GENESIS 2

Genesis 2 provides an intimate, focused narrative on humanity's creation and vocation:

**The Seventh Day Rest (2:1-3):**
- Completion and consecration of creation
- God's rest establishes the Sabbath pattern
- Time itself is sanctified

**The Garden Narrative (2:4-25):**
- Formation of Adam from dust and divine breath (2:7)
- Planting of Eden with the two trees (2:8-9)
- Four rivers and the geography of paradise (2:10-14)
- The vocational mandate: work and keep the garden (2:15)
- The prohibition: do not eat from the tree of knowledge (2:16-17)
- Adam's solitude and the creation of woman (2:18-25)

## CHRISTOLOGICAL READING OF GENESIS 2

**Christ as the True Adam:**
The Second Adam succeeds where the First Adam failed. Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 establish Christ as humanity's new representative head, undoing Adam's disobedience through perfect obedience.

**The Garden as Temple:**
Eden prefigures the temple and ultimately the Church. Just as Adam was placed in Eden to "work and keep" it (using priestly terminology), so Christ enters the world as true High Priest. The cherubim guarding Eden's entrance (3:24) reappear in the temple's design.

**The Two Trees:**
- **Tree of Life** → The Cross of Christ, which grants eternal life
- **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil** → The Law, which brings knowledge of sin but not power to obey

**The Deep Sleep:**
Adam's deep sleep (תַּרְדֵּמָה, tardemah) during Eve's formation typologically points to Christ's death, from whose pierced side the Church is born. As Eve came from Adam's side, so the Church comes from Christ's side (John 19:34).

**One Flesh Union:**
Genesis 2:24's "one flesh" mystery finds its ultimate meaning in Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). Marriage images the mystical union between Christ and His bride.

## THEOLOGICAL THEMES IN GENESIS 2

**Human Dignity and Vocation:**
- Humanity is dust animated by divine breath—both humble and exalted
- Work is pre-Fall, part of original blessing, not curse
- Dominion includes priestly stewardship of creation
- Naming the animals demonstrates humanity's God-given authority

**The Sabbath Rest:**
- The seventh day remains open-ended (no "evening and morning")
- God's rest is not exhaustion but satisfaction
- Hebrews 4 interprets the Sabbath as eschatological rest in Christ
- Christian worship on the eighth day (Sunday) celebrates the new creation

**Marriage as Divine Institution:**
- Woman is ezer kenegdo (עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ)—"helper corresponding to him"
- Not inferior but complementary, equal in dignity
- Marriage precedes the Fall—it is creation ordinance, not cultural construct
- One flesh union establishes permanent, exclusive covenant

**The Problem of Autonomy:**
- The prohibition establishes creaturely limits
- Obedience is the proper creaturely posture before the Creator
- The tree tests whether humanity will trust God's word
- Knowledge of good and evil means moral autonomy—deciding for oneself

## LITURGICAL CONNECTIONS

**The Sabbath in Orthodox Worship:**
- Saturday Vespers begin the weekly liturgical cycle
- Great Vespers includes Psalm 103 (LXX 104), celebrating creation
- The weekly Sabbath rest points to eternal rest in the Kingdom

**Marriage in the Church:**
- The Orthodox wedding service repeatedly references Genesis 2
- "What God has joined together" echoes God's forming of Eve
- The crowning ceremony recalls humanity's royal dignity
- Trinitarian blessing invokes the Creator's original design

**Baptism as New Creation:**
- The Spirit hovering over baptismal waters echoes Genesis 1:2
- Immersion is death and resurrection—new creation
- The baptized emerges as "new Adam" in Christ
- White garment replaces the fig leaves of shame

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

**Work as Worship:**
Genesis 2:15 establishes that work is not punishment but blessing. Christians are called to:
- Cultivate creation as God's image-bearers
- Approach labor as priestly service
- Rest weekly in imitation of the Creator
- Reject both idleness and workaholism

**Marriage as Sacrament:**
Genesis 2:24 grounds Christian marriage ethics:
- Monogamy: "a man" and "his wife" (singular)
- Permanence: "cleave" (דָּבַק, cleave/hold fast)
- Unity: "one flesh" establishes ontological bond
- Hierarchy: man leaves father/mother but cleaves to wife

**Limits and Obedience:**
The prohibition (2:16-17) teaches:
- Creaturely limits are not oppressive but protective
- Trust in God's word over autonomous reason
- Freedom exists within divinely established boundaries
- True wisdom comes through obedience, not independence

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CONCLUDING REFLECTION

Genesis 2 reveals God's intimate care in creation. Unlike Chapter 1's cosmic scope, Chapter 2 zooms to personal detail: God as gardener, potter, surgeon, and matchmaker. The LORD God forms, plants, breathes, takes, makes, and brings—every verb pulses with divine involvement.

The chapter establishes patterns that perdure through redemptive history:
- **Sabbath** → Eternal rest in the Kingdom
- **Garden** → Temple → Church → New Jerusalem
- **Adam** → Israel → Christ → Church
- **Marriage** → Christ and His bride

What began in Eden will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The tree of life, barred by cherubim, will be accessible again (Revelation 22:2). The river watering Eden becomes the river of life flowing from God's throne (Revelation 22:1). The garden-sanctuary expands to garden-city.

**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,**
**as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,**
**world without end. Amen.**
