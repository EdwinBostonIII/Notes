CHAPTER 50: JACOB'S DEATH AND JOSEPH'S FINAL YEARS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Genesis 50:15-17] — THE BROTHERS' FEAR: WILL JOSEPH NOW HATE US? (לוּ יִשְׂטְמֵנוּ יוֹסֵף)
When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be
that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which
we did to him." They sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded
before he died, saying, 'So you shall tell Joseph... Please forgive the sin
of the servants of the God of your father.'" Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
וַיִּרְא֤וּ אֲחֵֽי־יוֹסֵף֙ כִּי־מֵ֣ת אֲבִיהֶ֔ם וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ ל֥וּ יִשְׂטְמֵ֖נוּ יוֹסֵ֑ף וְהָשֵׁ֤ב יָשִׁיב֙ לָ֔נוּ
אֵ֚ת כָּל־הָ֣רָעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר גָּמַ֖לְנוּ אֹתֽוֹ׃

EXEGESIS:
The verb יִשְׂטְמֵנוּ (yistemenu, from שָׂטַם, "to bear a grudge, harbor enmity") is
the same verb used of Esau's hatred for Jacob after the stolen blessing (Genesis
27:41). The brothers fear that Joseph's forgiveness was strategic—maintained only
while Jacob lived to preserve family peace. Now, with Jacob dead, they expect
retribution: וְהָשֵׁב יָשִׁיב ("he will surely pay back")—the infinitive absolute
construction emphasizes certainty. Their appeal invokes Jacob's (perhaps invented)
deathbed command and identifies themselves as "servants of the God of your father"
(עַבְדֵי אֱלֹהֵי אָבִיךָ), seeking religious solidarity as protection. Joseph's
response—weeping (וַיֵּבְךְּ)—reveals wounded love: after all these years, after all
his provision, they still doubt his sincerity. The brothers' fear exposes the
persistent power of guilt; even when forgiven, the forgiven often cannot believe
forgiveness is real. Joseph's tears are not anger but grief—grief that his grace
has not yet fully penetrated their hearts. This dynamic prefigures the believer's
struggle to receive Christ's forgiveness: intellectually acknowledged but
emotionally doubted, the gift of grace often remains unclaimed by those for whom
it was freely given.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Luke 23:34
    "And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do
    (πάτερ, ἄφες αὐτοῖς, οὐ γὰρ οἴδασιν τί ποιοῦσιν).'" Joseph forgave brothers
    who knew their crime; Christ forgives executioners who were ignorant. Both
    demonstrate that forgiveness flows from the one wronged, not the wrongdoers.
    Joseph wept over his brothers' continuing fear; Christ prayed for His
    crucifiers' pardon. Divine-like forgiveness does not wait for apology—it
    initiates reconciliation.

  → Matthew 18:21-22
    "Then Peter came up and said to him, 'Lord, how often will my brother sin
    against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?' Jesus said to him,
    'I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times (ἑβδομηκοντάκις
    ἑπτά).'" Joseph had already forgiven in chapter 45; now, years later, he must
    forgive again the same offense—not a new sin but the brothers' renewed fear
    of the old one. Christ's "seventy-seven times" means forgiveness without limit,
    without statute of limitations. Joseph embodies this: the forgiveness given
    once remains valid; he does not withdraw it.

  → Romans 8:1
    "There is therefore now no condemnation (οὐδὲν ἄρα νῦν κατάκριμα) for those who
    are in Christ Jesus." The brothers lived in fear of condemnation despite
    Joseph's grace. Paul announces the gospel reality: those in Christ face "no
    condemnation"—none. Joseph's disposition toward his brothers mirrors Christ's
    toward believers: there is no future reckoning, no stored-up wrath, no
    vengeance waiting behind the gift. Grace is not conditional on the giver's mood.

  → 1 John 4:18
    "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear (ἡ τελεία ἀγάπη ἔξω
    βάλλει τὸν φόβον). For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has
    not been perfected in love." The brothers' fear reveals imperfect reception of
    Joseph's love. Perfect love—fully believed, fully received—expels fear of
    punishment. Joseph's love was perfect; the brothers' reception was imperfect.
    The same dynamic persists: God's love is complete, but believers often fail
    to live in its full assurance.

[Genesis 50:19-21] — SOVEREIGN PROVIDENCE: "GOD MEANT IT FOR GOOD" (אֱלֹהִים חֲשָׁבָהּ לְטֹבָה)
Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid, for am I in the place of God? As for
you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass,
as it is today, to save many people alive. Now therefore don't be afraid. I
will provide for you and your little ones." He comforted them, and spoke
kindly to them.
וַיֹּ֧אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֛ם יוֹסֵ֖ף אַל־תִּירָ֑אוּ כִּ֛י הֲתַ֥חַת אֱלֹהִ֖ים אָֽנִי׃ וְאַתֶּ֕ם חֲשַׁבְתֶּ֥ם עָלַ֖י רָעָ֑ה
אֱלֹהִים֙ חֲשָׁבָ֣הּ לְטֹבָ֔ה לְמַ֗עַן עֲשֹׂ֛ה כַּיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּ֖ה לְהַחֲיֹ֥ת עַם־רָֽב׃

EXEGESIS:
This verse contains one of Scripture's most profound theological statements about
providence. Joseph's rhetorical question הֲתַחַת אֱלֹהִים אָנִי ("am I in the place
of God?") refuses the role of judge—vengeance belongs to God alone (Deuteronomy
32:35). The contrast is grammatically precise: אַתֶּם חֲשַׁבְתֶּם ("you intended/
calculated")... אֱלֹהִים חֲשָׁבָהּ ("God intended/calculated")—the same verb חָשַׁב
(chashav, "to think, plan, reckon") with different subjects and outcomes. Human
intention: רָעָה (evil). Divine intention: לְטֹבָה (for good). The purpose clause
לְהַחֲיֹת עַם־רָב ("to preserve alive a great people") reveals God's salvific goal:
the brothers' murderous plot became the means of national preservation. Joseph's
conclusion—אָנֹכִי אֲכַלְכֵּל אֶתְכֶם ("I myself will provide for you")—demonstrates
that understanding providence produces not passive resignation but active grace.
Seeing God's hand in his suffering liberates Joseph to bless those who cursed him.
This theology of providence becomes foundational for Christian interpretation of
the cross: what humanity intended as evil (crucifying the Son), God intended for
good (saving the world).

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Acts 2:23-24
    "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of
    God (τῇ ὡρισμένῃ βουλῇ καὶ προγνώσει τοῦ θεοῦ), you crucified and killed by
    the hands of lawless men. God raised him up." Peter's Pentecost sermon applies
    Joseph's providence-theology to the cross. The crucifixion was simultaneously
    human crime ("lawless men") and divine plan ("definite plan and foreknowledge").
    What the brothers did to Joseph, what the Jews and Romans did to Christ—in
    both cases, human evil serves divine salvation.

  → Romans 8:28
    "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good
    (πάντα συνεργεῖ εἰς ἀγαθόν), for those who are called according to his purpose."
    Paul generalizes Joseph's specific experience into a universal principle for
    believers. The אֱלֹהִים חֲשָׁבָהּ לְטֹבָה ("God meant it for good") becomes πάντα
    συνεργεῖ εἰς ἀγαθόν ("all things work together for good"). Not some things—all
    things. Not eventually—intrinsically. Divine providence weaves even evil into
    the tapestry of redemption.

  → Isaiah 53:10
    "Yet it was the will of YHWH to crush him (וַיהוָה חָפֵץ דַּכְּאוֹ); he has put
    him to grief... he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will
    of YHWH shall prosper in his hand." Isaiah reveals that the Servant's suffering
    was divinely intended (חָפֵץ, "pleased, willed"), not merely permitted. The
    Father's active will in the Son's suffering parallels God's active intention
    in Joseph's suffering—both serve "to save many alive."

  → Genesis 45:5-8
    "Now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here,
    for God sent me before you to preserve life (לְמִחְיָה)... God sent me before
    you to preserve for you a remnant on earth." Joseph's earlier statement
    establishes the theology he now repeats. The verb לְמִחְיָה/לְהַחֲיֹת ("to
    preserve/give life") appears in both passages—the purpose of his suffering
    was life-giving. What the cross accomplishes cosmically, Joseph accomplished
    typologically: life through apparent death, salvation through suffering.

[Genesis 50:24-26] — JOSEPH'S DEATHBED FAITH: "GOD WILL SURELY VISIT YOU" (פָּקֹד יִפְקֹד)
Joseph said to his brothers, "I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and
bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac,
and to Jacob." Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, "God
will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." So Joseph
died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put
in a coffin in Egypt.
וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־אֶחָ֔יו אָנֹכִ֖י מֵ֑ת וֵֽאלֹהִ֞ים פָּקֹ֤ד יִפְקֹד֙ אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְהֶעֱלָ֤ה אֶתְכֶם֙
מִן־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֛ע לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹֽב׃

EXEGESIS:
The phrase פָּקֹד יִפְקֹד (paqod yifqod, "visiting He will visit" = "God will surely
visit") employs the infinitive absolute for emphatic certainty. The verb פָּקַד
(paqad) means "to visit, attend to, take note of, intervene"—divine visitation
that changes circumstances. This phrase becomes the exodus watchword: when Moses
announces deliverance, he will use this exact formula (Exodus 3:16; 4:31), and the
people will recognize it as the prophetic password passed down from Joseph.
Joseph's faith is remarkable: he possesses everything Egypt can offer—wealth,
power, family restored—yet he knows Egypt is not home. His instructions regarding
his bones (וְהַעֲלִתֶם אֶת־עַצְמֹתַי מִזֶּה, "you shall carry up my bones from here")
make his burial contingent on a future he will not see. The coffin (אָרוֹן) in
Egypt becomes a perpetual witness: Joseph's body waits for exodus; his faith
outlives his death. For four centuries, that coffin will remind Israel that God
promised to visit them and that the bones of their ancestor are waiting to go home.
Genesis ends not with arrival but with anticipation—a coffin in Egypt, pointing
toward exodus, toward Canaan, toward resurrection.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Hebrews 11:22
    "By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the
    Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones (περὶ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ
    ἐνετείλατο)." The Hebrews author identifies this as Joseph's supreme act of
    faith. Not his rise to power, not his forgiveness of his brothers, but his
    dying instructions about bones. Faith looks beyond death; faith makes plans
    for a future it cannot see; faith refuses to let its remains rest in the
    wrong country.

  → Exodus 13:19
    "Moses took the bones of Joseph with him (וַיִּקַּח מֹשֶׁה אֶת־עַצְמוֹת יוֹסֵף
    עִמּוֹ), for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, 'God
    will surely visit you (פָּקֹד יִפְקֹד אֱלֹהִים אֶתְכֶם), and you shall carry up
    my bones with you from here.'" The fulfillment after four centuries. Moses
    remembers the oath; the bones travel with the exodus generation; Joseph's
    faith is vindicated. The very words פָּקֹד יִפְקֹד that Joseph spoke now
    describe what has happened.

  → Joshua 24:32
    "As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt,
    they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob bought from the
    sons of Hamor." Final fulfillment in the Promised Land. The journey begun in
    Genesis 50 ends in Joshua 24—from Egyptian coffin to Canaanite grave. Joseph's
    faith, expressed in dying instructions, finds its rest in the land sworn to
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

  → Acts 7:15-16
    "And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, and they
    were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb (εἰς τὸ μνῆμα)." Stephen's
    historical summary confirms the bones' final destination. The coffin in Egypt
    was never meant to be permanent; it was faith's temporary lodging until the
    promise was fulfilled. Joseph died knowing he would be moved; he rested in
    hope of visitation.

  → Hebrews 11:13-16
    "These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having
    seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were
    strangers and exiles on the earth... they desire a better country, that is, a
    heavenly one." Joseph's bones-instruction fits the pattern: dying without
    receiving, greeting the promise from afar, acknowledging that Egypt was exile.
    The "better country" Joseph sought was not merely Canaan but the resurrection
    that Canaan typified—the final "bringing up" when all bones will rise.
