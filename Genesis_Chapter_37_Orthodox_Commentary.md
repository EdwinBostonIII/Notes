              פרק לז — CHAPTER 37: JOSEPH'S DREAMS AND BETRAYAL
                      יוֹסֵף — THE BELOVED SON SOLD INTO EGYPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Chapter 37 begins the Joseph narrative (chapters 37-50), the longest sustained narrative in Genesis and perhaps the most developed Christological type in the Old Testament. Joseph (יוֹסֵף, "may he add") is the beloved son of his father, hated by his brothers without cause, stripped of his garment, cast into a pit (בּוֹר, type of death/Sheol), sold for silver, delivered to Gentiles, and will eventually become savior of those who rejected him. The Fathers unanimously recognized Joseph as τύπος Χριστοῦ (typos Christou, "type of Christ"): both are beloved sons sent by their fathers, both are betrayed by their own, both descend before ascending, both save their persecutors through suffering. Stephen's speech in Acts 7 develops this typology explicitly. The כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים (ketonet passim, often "coat of many colors") marks Joseph as specially favored—perhaps a royal or priestly garment—provoking the envy that leads to his descent. Yet what brothers intend for evil, God will transform to good (50:20)—the theological key to the entire narrative.

[Genesis 37:3-4] — THE BELOVED SON AND THE COAT OF DISTINCTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

וְיִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל אָהַ֤ב אֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ מִכָּל־בָּנָ֔יו כִּֽי־בֶן־זְקֻנִ֥ים ה֖וּא ל֑וֹ וְעָ֥שָׂה ל֖וֹ כְּתֹ֥נֶת פַּסִּֽים׃ וַיִּרְא֣וּ אֶחָ֗יו כִּֽי־אֹת֞וֹ אָהַ֤ב אֲבִיהֶם֙ מִכָּל־אֶחָ֔יו וַֽיִּשְׂנְא֖וּ אֹת֑וֹ וְלֹ֥א יָכְל֖וּ דַּבְּר֥וֹ לְשָׁלֹֽם׃

"Now Israel loved Joseph (יִשְׂרָאֵל אָהַב אֶת־יוֹסֵף) more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age (בֶן־זְקֻנִים); and he made him a tunic of many colors (כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים). But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him (וַיִּשְׂנְאוּ אֹתוֹ) and could not speak peaceably to him (וְלֹא יָכְלוּ דַּבְּרוֹ לְשָׁלֹם)."

EXEGESIS:

The narrative opens with emphatic love: יִשְׂרָאֵל אָהַב אֶת־יוֹסֵף ("Israel loved Joseph")—using the covenant name "Israel" (not "Jacob") suggests this love participates in divine election. The phrase בֶן־זְקֻנִים ("son of old age") echoes Isaac's designation (21:2, 7), linking Joseph typologically to the promised son. The כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים is notoriously difficult to translate: פַּס may mean "palm/sole" (suggesting long sleeves and hem—a royal garment), or derive from a root meaning "ornamented/colored." The only other biblical occurrence describes the garment of virgin princesses (2 Samuel 13:18-19). This is not merely a "pretty coat" but a marker of special status—perhaps indicating that Jacob intended Joseph to receive the double blessing normally given to the firstborn. The brothers' response is visceral: וַיִּשְׂנְאוּ אֹתוֹ ("they hated him")—the same verb used of Esau's hatred for Jacob (27:41). They וְלֹא יָכְלוּ דַּבְּרוֹ לְשָׁלֹם ("could not speak to him for peace/peaceably")—hatred destroys even ordinary communication. Joseph becomes the innocent recipient of murderous envy.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Matthew 3:17; 17:5
    "And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my beloved Son (οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός), with whom I am well pleased.'" The Father publicly declares His love for the Son—as Israel declared his love for Joseph. Both beloved sons are sent to their brothers, both are rejected by those who should have received them. The Father's love for the Son provokes the world's hatred (John 15:18-24).

  → John 1:11
    "He came to his own (εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἦλθεν), and his own people did not receive him (οἱ ἴδιοι αὐτὸν οὐ παρέλαβον)." John's prologue echoes Joseph's experience exactly: the beloved son comes to "his own" (brothers, Israel) and is rejected. Yet rejection becomes the means of salvation for the world (John 1:12)—as Joseph's rejection leads to Egypt and the preservation of many.

  → John 15:24-25
    "If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father (μεμισήκασιν καὶ ἐμὲ καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου). But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: 'They hated me without cause' (ἐμίσησάν με δωρεάν)." Jesus quotes Psalm 69:4, applying the psalmist's innocent suffering to Himself. Joseph too was hated "without cause"—not for sin but for his father's love and God's favor.

  → Acts 7:9
    "And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph (ζηλώσαντες τὸν Ἰωσήφ), sold him into Egypt; but God was with him (ὁ θεὸς ἦν μετ' αὐτοῦ)." Stephen's sermon in Acts 7 explicitly develops Joseph as Christ-type. The word "jealous" (ζηλόω) identifies the sin—not merely hatred but envy of another's blessing. Yet God's presence transforms their evil into salvation.

[Genesis 37:5-8] — THE PROPHETIC DREAMS AND INTENSIFIED HATRED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיַּחֲלֹ֤ם יוֹסֵף֙ חֲל֔וֹם וַיַּגֵּ֖ד לְאֶחָ֑יו וַיּוֹסִ֥פוּ ע֖וֹד שְׂנֹ֥א אֹתֽוֹ׃ ... וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ ל֔וֹ הֲמָלֹ֤ךְ תִּמְלֹךְ֙ עָלֵ֔ינוּ אִם־מָשׁ֥וֹל תִּמְשֹׁ֖ל בָּ֑נוּ וַיּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔וֹ עַל־חֲלֹמֹתָ֖יו וְעַל־דְּבָרָֽיו׃

"And Joseph dreamed a dream (וַיַּחֲלֹם יוֹסֵף חֲלוֹם), and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him even more (וַיּוֹסִפוּ עוֹד שְׂנֹא אֹתוֹ)... And they said to him, 'Are you indeed to reign over us (הֲמָלֹךְ תִּמְלֹךְ עָלֵינוּ)? Are you indeed to rule over us (אִם־מָשׁוֹל תִּמְשֹׁל בָּנוּ)?' And they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words."

EXEGESIS:

The doubling of חֲלוֹם ("dream") emphasizes divine origin—in the ancient world, repeated dreams indicated certain fulfillment. Joseph's dreams (sheaves bowing, sun/moon/stars bowing) prophesy his future rule. The brothers' outraged question employs emphatic infinitive absolute constructions: הֲמָלֹךְ תִּמְלֹךְ ("will you actually reign?") and מָשׁוֹל תִּמְשֹׁל ("will you actually rule?")—the doubling expresses incredulity and rejection. Their very protest confirms the dream: they understood its meaning perfectly. The phrase וַיּוֹסִפוּ עוֹד שְׂנֹא ("they added still more to hate") shows hatred compounding—each new revelation of Joseph's destiny intensifies their enmity. They hate him "for his dreams and for his words" (עַל־חֲלֹמֹתָיו וְעַל־דְּבָרָיו)—for what God revealed through him and for his faithful reporting. The brothers rage against divine election working through human vessel.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Luke 19:14
    "But his citizens hated him (οἱ δὲ πολῖται αὐτοῦ ἐμίσουν αὐτόν) and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us' (οὐ θέλομεν τοῦτον βασιλεῦσαι ἐφ' ἡμᾶς)." Jesus' parable of the minas includes this direct parallel to Joseph's brothers' rejection: "We do not want this one to reign over us." Israel's rejection of Jesus mirrors the brothers' rejection of Joseph's prophesied kingship.

  → Matthew 21:37-39
    "'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir (οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος); come, let us kill him and have his inheritance (κατάσχωμεν τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ).' And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him." The parable of the wicked tenants parallels Joseph's story: the heir is recognized, envied, and killed/sold to eliminate his claim. Jesus explicitly applies this to Israel's leaders' rejection of Him.

  → Psalm 2:1-3
    "Why do the nations rage (לָמָּה רָגְשׁוּ גוֹיִם) and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves... against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, 'Let us burst their bonds apart.'" The rage against God's chosen king echoes the brothers' rage against Joseph's prophesied rule. Human rebellion against divine appointment is futile—Joseph does reign; Christ does reign.

[Genesis 37:18-20] — THE CONSPIRACY TO MURDER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיִּרְא֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ מֵרָחֹ֑ק וּבְטֶ֙רֶם֙ יִקְרַ֣ב אֲלֵיהֶ֔ם וַיִּֽתְנַכְּל֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ לַהֲמִיתֽוֹ׃ וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־אָחִ֑יו הִנֵּ֗ה בַּ֛עַל הַחֲלֹמ֥וֹת הַלָּזֶ֖ה בָּֽא׃ וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ לְכ֣וּ וְנַהַרְגֵ֗הוּ וְנַשְׁלִכֵ֙הוּ֙ בְּאַחַ֣ד הַבֹּר֔וֹת

"And they saw him from afar (וַיִּרְאוּ אֹתוֹ מֵרָחֹק), and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him (וַיִּתְנַכְּלוּ אֹתוֹ לַהֲמִיתוֹ). And they said to one another, 'Behold, this master of dreams comes (הִנֵּה בַּעַל הַחֲלֹמוֹת הַלָּזֶה בָּא)! Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits (וְנַשְׁלִכֵהוּ בְּאַחַד הַבֹּרוֹת).'"

EXEGESIS:

The verb וַיִּתְנַכְּלוּ (vayitnakkelu, "they conspired/plotted craftily") from the root נָכַל suggests cunning and deceit—the same root describes the serpent as עָרוּם (crafty) in 3:1. Murder is premeditated: they see Joseph "from afar" (מֵרָחֹק), giving time for deliberation. The sarcastic title בַּעַל הַחֲלֹמוֹת ("master/lord of dreams") reveals their true fear: these dreams may be divine revelation, and Joseph may indeed rule. Their solution is elimination: "let us kill him" (נַהַרְגֵהוּ) and "throw him into one of the pits" (וְנַשְׁלִכֵהוּ בְּאַחַד הַבֹּרוֹת). The בּוֹר (pit/cistern) in ancient Israel served as both water storage and prison/grave—Joseph's descent into the pit prefigures descent into Sheol. The brothers' stated goal: "we shall see what will become of his dreams" (וְנִרְאֶה מַה־יִּהְיוּ חֲלֹמֹתָיו)—human conspiracy attempting to nullify divine revelation. They will indeed see what becomes of his dreams: the dreams will be fulfilled through the very conspiracy meant to prevent them.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Matthew 26:3-4
    "Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest... and plotted together (συνεβουλεύσαντο) to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him (ἀποκτείνωσιν)." The parallel is precise: religious leaders "plotting" (same deliberate conspiracy) to kill the one whose claims threatened their position. Joseph's brothers and the Sanhedrin share the same murderous response to divine revelation.

  → Acts 4:27-28
    "For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus... both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place (ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου καὶ ἡ βουλὴ προώρισεν γενέσθαι)." The early church understood: human conspiracy against God's anointed accomplishes God's predetermined plan. The brothers' conspiracy against Joseph fulfills, not thwarts, the divine dream.

  → Mark 12:7
    "But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours' (δεῦτε ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἡμῶν ἔσται ἡ κληρονομία)." The verbal parallels are striking: "come, let us kill" (לְכוּ וְנַהַרְגֵהוּ / δεῦτε ἀποκτείνωμεν)—the same conspiracy, the same false hope that eliminating the heir eliminates the inheritance claim.

[Genesis 37:23-24] — STRIPPED AND CAST INTO THE PIT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

וַיְהִ֕י כַּאֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א יוֹסֵ֖ף אֶל־אֶחָ֑יו וַיַּפְשִׁ֤יטוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־כֻּתָּנְתּ֔וֹ אֶת־כְּתֹ֥נֶת הַפַּסִּ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָלָֽיו׃ וַיִּקָּחֻ֔הוּ וַיַּשְׁלִ֥כוּ אֹת֖וֹ הַבֹּ֑רָה וְהַבּ֣וֹר רֵ֔ק אֵ֥ין בּ֖וֹ מָֽיִם׃

"And when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic (וַיַּפְשִׁיטוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף אֶת־כֻּתָּנְתּוֹ), the tunic of many colors that was on him (אֶת־כְּתֹנֶת הַפַּסִּים אֲשֶׁר עָלָיו). And they took him and threw him into the pit (וַיַּשְׁלִכוּ אֹתוֹ הַבֹּרָה). Now the pit was empty (וְהַבּוֹר רֵק); there was no water in it (אֵין בּוֹ מָיִם)."

EXEGESIS:

The stripping of Joseph's garment is violent and deliberate: וַיַּפְשִׁיטוּ ("they stripped") is an aggressive act of humiliation—removing the symbol of his father's love and special status. The כְּתֹנֶת הַפַּסִּים is named again, emphasizing that this particular garment—the mark of favor—was their target. Joseph is not merely pushed into a pit; he is first reduced to nakedness, stripped of his identity as the beloved son. The בּוֹר ("pit/cistern") serves as a holding place before death—in Hebrew thought, a type of Sheol. The narrator's note "the pit was empty; there was no water in it" (וְהַבּוֹר רֵק אֵין בּוֹ מָיִם) emphasizes: Joseph won't drown but will remain alive in this death-like state. The pit becomes symbol of descent before ascent—Joseph must go down (into pit, into slavery, into prison) before he rises to rule. The typology points to Christ's descent into death (and Hades) before His resurrection and exaltation.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Matthew 27:28, 35
    "And they stripped him (ἐκδύσαντες αὐτόν) and put a scarlet robe on him... And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them (διεμερίσαντο τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ) by casting lots." Christ is stripped as Joseph was stripped—both divested of garments by those who would harm them. The soldiers' division of Jesus' clothes echoes the brothers' handling of Joseph's tunic (37:31-33).

  → John 19:23-24
    "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts (ἔλαβον τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησαν τέσσαρα μέρη)... that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, 'They divided my garments among them.'" John sees Psalm 22:18 fulfilled—garments divided. Joseph's stripped tunic prefigures this moment: the beloved son's garment taken by those who reject him.

  → Psalm 69:1-2, 14-15
    "Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck (כִּי בָאוּ מַיִם עַד־נָפֶשׁ). I sink in deep mire (טָבַעְתִּי בִּיוֵן מְצוּלָה) where there is no foothold... Deliver me from sinking in the mire (הַצִּילֵנִי מִטִּיט); let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters (וּמִמַּעֲמַקֵּי־מָיִם)." The Messianic psalm echoes the pit imagery. Joseph's pit "had no water" (אֵין בּוֹ מָיִם); the psalmist cries from waters and mire—both describe the death-like state from which God delivers.

  → 1 Peter 3:18-19
    "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous (δίκαιος ὑπὲρ ἀδίκων)... being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison." The descent-before-ascent pattern: Christ descended into death/Hades before rising. Joseph's time in the pit typifies this descent—innocent suffering that leads to exaltation and salvation of others.

[Genesis 37:26-28] — SOLD FOR SILVER: JUDAH'S COUNSEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוּדָ֖ה אֶל־אֶחָ֑יו מַה־בֶּ֗צַע כִּ֤י נַהֲרֹג֙ אֶת־אָחִ֔ינוּ וְכִסִּ֖ינוּ אֶת־דָּמֽוֹ׃ לְכ֞וּ וְנִמְכְּרֶ֣נּוּ לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֗ים וְיָדֵ֙נוּ֙ אַל־תְּהִי־ב֔וֹ כִּֽי־אָחִ֥ינוּ בְשָׂרֵ֖נוּ ה֑וּא וַיִּשְׁמְע֖וּ אֶחָֽיו׃ ... וַיִּמְכְּר֧וּ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֛ף לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֖ים בְּעֶשְׂרִ֣ים כָּ֑סֶף וַיָּבִ֥יאוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף מִצְרָֽיְמָה׃

"And Judah said to his brothers, 'What profit is it (מַה־בֶּצַע) if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites (לְכוּ וְנִמְכְּרֶנּוּ לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִים), and let our hand not be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh (כִּי־אָחִינוּ בְשָׂרֵנוּ הוּא).' And his brothers listened... And they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver (בְּעֶשְׂרִים כָּסֶף), and they brought Joseph into Egypt."

EXEGESIS:

Judah's question מַה־בֶּצַע ("what profit?") reveals his motivations: not conscience about murder but practical gain. The word בֶּצַע (betsa') means "profit, gain, unjust gain"—it appears in prophetic condemnation of covetousness (Isaiah 56:11; Jeremiah 6:13). Judah calculates: death brings no profit; sale brings silver. His rationale "he is our brother, our flesh" (אָחִינוּ בְשָׂרֵנוּ) acknowledges kinship while planning betrayal—the same blood-bond he invokes becomes the instrument of sale. The price בְּעֶשְׂרִים כָּסֶף ("twenty shekels of silver") was the standard price for a slave in the second millennium BCE (Leviticus 27:5 prices a male five to twenty years at twenty shekels). Joseph is sold at market rate—the beloved son valued as common merchandise. The purchasers are יִשְׁמְעֵאלִים (Ishmaelites)—descendants of Abraham's other son, Ishmael—an ironic note: one line of Abraham sells another. Joseph descends into Egypt, setting the stage for the Exodus.

CROSS-REFERENCES:

  → Matthew 26:14-16
    "Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot (Ἰούδας Ἰσκαριώτης), went to the chief priests and said, 'What will you give me (τί θέλετέ μοι δοῦναι) if I deliver him over to you?' And they paid him thirty pieces of silver (τριάκοντα ἀργύρια)." The verbal and thematic parallels are overwhelming: Judah (יְהוּדָה) / Judas (Ἰούδας)—same Hebrew name; both ask about profit; both sell a brother for silver; both deliver the beloved to Gentile hands. Joseph for twenty shekels, Jesus for thirty (the increased price reflects inflation, or the servant's value at thirty, per Exodus 21:32).

  → Zechariah 11:12-13
    "Then I said to them, 'If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.' And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver (שְׁלֹשִׁים כָּסֶף). Then the LORD said to me, 'Throw it to the potter'—the lordly price at which I was priced by them (אֶדֶר הַיְקָר אֲשֶׁר יָקַרְתִּי מֵעֲלֵיהֶם)." Zechariah's prophecy drips with sarcasm: "the lordly price" at which the shepherd is valued—slave-price for the shepherd of Israel. Matthew 27:9-10 sees this fulfilled in Judas's betrayal-money thrown into the temple.

  → Acts 7:9
    "And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt (ἀπέδοντο εἰς Αἴγυπτον); but God was with him (ὁ θεὸς ἦν μετ' αὐτοῦ)." Stephen's summary captures the essential typology: sold by brothers, delivered to foreign nation, yet God's presence transforms betrayal into salvation. The phrase "God was with him" becomes the refrain of Joseph's life—and the reality of Christ's experience.
