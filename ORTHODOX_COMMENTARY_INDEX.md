## Theological Framework

### **Key Hermeneutical Principles:**

**1. Christological Reading:**
All of Genesis points to Christ. The Fathers read the Old Testament through the lens of the Incarnation, Death, and Resurrection.

**2. Typological Interpretation:**
Old Testament persons, events, and institutions are types (τύποι) that foreshadow New Testament antitypes:
- Adam → Christ (Last Adam)
- Eve → Mary (New Eve) / Church
- Tree of Life → The Cross
- Passover Lamb → Christ the Lamb of God
- Isaac's binding → Christ's sacrifice
- Joseph's suffering → Christ's passion

**3. Liturgical Reading:**
Scripture is alive in worship. Orthodox services constantly reference Genesis:
- Great Vespers: Psalm 103 (creation)
- Pascha Vigil: Genesis 1 (new creation)
- Theophany: Genesis 1:2 (Spirit over waters)
- Marriage service: Genesis 2:24 (one flesh)

**4. Patristic Consensus:**
Orthodox interpretation follows the consensus of the Church Fathers, presented here as established theological truth rather than individual opinions.

**5. Spiritual and Moral Application:**
Scripture is not merely history but living word calling us to repentance, faith, and holiness.

**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,**
**now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.**
